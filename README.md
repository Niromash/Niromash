**I started the development with discord bots, it was about 4 years ago during the explosion of Discord.JS tutorials (Javascript framework to create easily Discord bots) on YouTube, I could thanks to that forge me solid algebraic knowledge and solid bases in the object oriented languages. After that I turned to the Rest API with express.js. This domain has been a lot more interesting for me, the possibilities to concretize my creativity were much more advanced than the discord bots. I was always looking for the clarity of the code and its performance. So I switched to TypeScript after a short passage on Java whose structure I liked a lot. I tried to produce a very structured code as Java could be by exploiting at the maximum the abstraction of classes, the inheritance... I stayed quite a long time on TypeScript, almost 3 years where I could try a lot of stuff, I also changed my web framework to Fastify, it was so fast compared to Express and I quickly got comfortable on Fastify. I started to link what I was doing in TypeScript (almost only Rest API) with other domains, Minecraft plugins, I was able to make a clone of HiveMC's Block Party game (including a web panel to play custom music depending on the state of the game on Minecraft) and I really liked linking these 2 applications. So I started to make an on-demand server infrastructure on Minecraft and I could discover Docker and in parallel in DevOps (CI/CD with github/gitea, jenkins, keycloak...) then I discovered after having succeeded in making a solid infrastructure with TypeScript and Docker Swarm that I could push even further its performances by discovering Go (from its full name "Golang", language created by Google allowing scalability, performance and simplicity). Then in parallel Kubernetes, I started to learn Go and Kubernetes by recreating an infrastructure of servers on demand more powerful (thanks to the many assets that Go offered), while working throughout this epic with other self-taught developers too. One was in charge of the in-game system (Core), and others were in charge of creating mini games that worked with the infrastructure. So here I am now, a back-end developer, mainly in Go and previously in JavaScript, with a solid base in Java and Python (acquired thanks to the NSI speciality in high school).](I started the development with discord bots, it was about 4 years ago during the explosion of Discord.JS tutorials (Javascript framework to create easily Discord bots) on YouTube, I could thanks to that forge me solid algebraic knowledge and solid bases in the object oriented languages.
